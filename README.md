This is a Hybrid Mobile Application for the project IsoSec based on the theme of Internet of things (IOT).
IsoSec or Isolated Security is our solution to the security problems faced by Residential areas. IsoSec provides automation to the process of entering

people are provided by the resident prior to their arrival. This application can grant access, validate OTP and run sessions of the visitors.<br>
